There is no hate without fear. Hate is crystallized fear, fears divided, fears objectivized . We hate what we fear and so where hate is, fear is lurking. Thus we hate what threatens our person, our vanity and our dereams and plans for ourselves. If we can isolate this element in what we hate we may be able to cease from hating.
